Define the Skill entity and its stages for the backend.
This is planning only—no code yet.

Tasks:
1. Define Skill fields:
   - Name (e.g., React, SQL)
   - Description/goal
   - Category (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
   - Status (active, archived)
   - Created date
2. Plan one-to-many relationship: one User → many Skills
3. Define Skill Stages:
   - Stage types: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
   - Stage-specific goals (optional)
   - Stage progression logic
4. Outline data for Practice Logs and Evidence links
5. Document all planning in `docs/skills.md`
